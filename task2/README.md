Since by learning from first task there is some issues in fetching details from given api may be the access code given was not properly used by me.
Hence I have decided to prove my proficiency by using fake api to fetch details in place of the given api

The server is running!!

This is user post data fetched form api to style this I have used CSS

To make more difference as in e-commerce the user data is also crucial so new user data is fetched everytime from api whnerever Refresh user button is pressed

You can see the change in user profile
